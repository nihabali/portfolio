    bio: "Hi, I am Nihab Ali, a student with a deep interest in technology and digital freedom. I enjoy exploring open source tools, privacy focused apps, and discovering how things work behind the scenes. When I am not digging into tech, you will probably find me watching anime, listening to music, or playing games. I believe in keeping things minimal, clean, and meaningful both online and offline.",
